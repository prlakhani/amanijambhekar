## Surgery
[I am currently leading](https://millenniumphysicians.com/amani-jambhekar-md-mba/) the breast surgical oncology program for [Millenium Physicians](https://millenniumphysicians.com/), a multidisciplinary clinical group with offices around Greater Houston. Prior to joining Millenium, I completed my Breast Surgical Oncology fellowship at Columbia University Medical Center and my General Surgery residency at New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, both in New York City. I received my MD from University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. During my undergraduate education I triple majored in English, Biology, and Psychology and received a BA and BS from Tulane University in New Orleans.


## Business Leadership
Near the end of my formal surgical training, I realized although surgeons were leaders in their groups and operating rooms, we were never taught to be effective leaders.Throughout my training, and moving into my role, I noticed many opportunities for potential operational improvements, as well as opportunities to make the OR more inclusive. These could make a real difference in the lives of both patients and those of us who care for them! However, I lacked the language and exposure to the types of analysis that could help me make my case convincingly. [This led me](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGPoRfGB5eL/) to the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, where I received my MBA and was named one of [Poets and Quants Best and Brightest MBA graduates in the country](https://poetsandquants.com/2020/06/08/2020-best-brightest-online-mbas-amani-jambhekar-indiana-university-kelley/). The projects and classwork prepared me for the rigors of starting my own program and running a truly patient-centric practice. I additionally use this perspective to educate future surgeons about how to represent themselves during the job search and other business topics not typically covered in surgical training.
