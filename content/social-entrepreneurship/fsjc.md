I started the [Future Surgeons Journal Club](https://www.instagram.com/futuresurgeonsjournalclub/) to help future surgeons develop a skill set to critically analyze surgical literature; I simultaneously wanted to highlight female surgeons in various surgical subspecialities. We host monthly reviews of a landmark papers on Instagram Live. Students from high school through medical school are invited to read the paper ahead of time, follow along as key figures and findings are discussed, and ask clarifying questions as they arise. Since its founding in May 2020, FSJC has been hosted by a variety of guest moderators who have been able to provide insights from their respective fields.
