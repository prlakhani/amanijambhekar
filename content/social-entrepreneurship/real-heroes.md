During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the key barriers to providing safe and effective care for all patients has been the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. [Real Heroes Need Masks](https://www.realheroesneedmasks.com/) started as a project for a Kelley School of Business design sprint and lasted until supply chains could ramp up mask production again.

My core realization was that overworked hospitals in underserved regions rarely had the extra administrative time to apply to receive masks or other PPE from larger mask supply initiatives. At the same time, healthcare workers had an informal network with their peers and understood where the need was greatest while still being unmet. Real Heroes Need Masks rapidly set up a donation infrastructure for medical-grade PPE as well as ways to donate financially so these could be purchased directly from reputable suppliers, and the distribution infrastructure needed to get masks where they were needed. The more than 73,000 masks we distributed helped save countless lives from March to October 2020.
