To encourage future surgeons to become comfortable reading new research, I started the [Future Surgeons Journal Club](https://www.instagram.com/futuresurgeonsjournalclub/). We host approximately monthly reviews of a single new or particularly groundbreaking piece of surgical literature on Instagram Live. Students from high school through medical school are invited to read the paper ahead of time, follow along as key figures and findings are discussed, and ask clarifying questions as they arise. Since its founding in May 2020, FSJC has been hosted by a variety of guest moderators who have been able to provide insights from their respective fields of expertise.
