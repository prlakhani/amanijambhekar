As someone vocal about the grueling and often confusing process of embarking on a career in healthcare, students frequently asked me questions to try to make more informed decisions along their own paths. I realized that I would have loved to have had the benefit of a rich resource of information from those already in the field. That is what drew me to create [The Virtual Mentor](https://thevirtualmentor.org), a website and community focused on building up such a resource for the generations of healthcare workers to come.
