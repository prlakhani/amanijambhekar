Through much of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the key barriers to providing safe and effective care for all patients has been the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. [Real Heroes Need Masks](https://www.realheroesneedmasks.com/) started as a project for a Kelley School of Business weekend design sprint, but was one of the few projects that sustained itself long afterwards and created a real impact in the communities it touched. 

My core realization was that overworked hospitals in underserved regions rarely had the extra administrative time to apply to receive masks or other PPE from larger mask supply initiatives. At the same time, healthcare workers had an informal network with their peers and understood where the need was greatest while still being unmet. Real Heroes Need Masks rapidly set up a donation infrastructure for medical-grade PPE, as well as ways to donate so these could be purchased directly from reputable suppliers, as well as the distribution infrastructure needed to get masks where they were needed. The more than 73,000 masks we distributed helped save countless lives during this pandemic.
