All women are still haunted and fighting,  
The invisible demons, trolls, and ghosts,  
Shaming, victim blaming, and gaslighting,  
We push through the struggle while being good hosts.  

Post the Me Too era but pre Yes, Me  
Have we faced biases? I have, me too  
Discrimination and he above she?  
We keep marching for the dreams we pursue.   

So when will the Yes, Me era arrive?  
When the right answer can also be “her,”  
Who will enter the “boys’ club” and survive?  
Who will thrive, not just survive - but conquer?  

Who will be surgeons, astronauts, and the President?  
Yes, Me, and who will be mechanics, engineers, and film critics?  
Yes, Me, and who will report sexual harassment?  
Yes, Me, and who will believe us instead of blaming theatrics?  

Yes, Me is the golden era for us,  
Each woman treated the same as a man,  
Misogyny and pay gap’s broken truss,  
Yes, me. I’m a woman. Yes, me - I can.
