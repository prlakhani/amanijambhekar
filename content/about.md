Hi there! I'm a Houston-based breast surgical oncologist with an MBA. I have been passionate about using my experience and training to advocate for the underprivileged and underrepresented wherever I can, and have found many opportunities and friends along the way.

I am innovating in the use of social media to inform, educate and empower people interested in learning and growing with me. Check out some of the ways I use this power in the [Projects](/projects/) section.

I maintain balance by traveling and exploring the great outdoors. I also try to engage my more artistic side as often as possible through [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ajvictorymd/) and [writing](/posts/).
